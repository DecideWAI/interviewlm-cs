## DISCOUNT POLICY (For Sales Leadership)

### When Can Sales Offer Discounts?

```
RULE 1: Maintain Minimum Gross Margin
- Never discount below 60% gross margin
- $20 base = minimum $8/assessment price
- For packs: Never go below Small Pack pricing ($18)

RULE 2: Discount Authority by Tier
AE Authority:
- Small Pack: 10% max discount (already included in pack)
- Medium Pack: 5% max discount (bring to $714 from $750)
- Large Pack: 10% max discount (bring to $2,160 from $2,400)
- Enterprise: VP/Director approval required

RULE 3: Bundling Instead of Price Cuts
Instead of: "I'll give you 15% off"
Say: "I'll include 6 months of dedicated support at no extra cost"
Or: "I'll throw in custom integrations (worth $5K) for free"

RULE 4: Volume Commitment Requirement
Only offer discounts for:
- Annual prepay (not monthly)
- 12-month contracts (not 6-month)
- Volume commitment (3+ packs at once)

RULE 5: Review & Governance
- Weekly review of discounts given
- Monthly P&L impact analysis
- Quarterly pricing strategy review
- Never discount more than 5 customers/month without approval
```
