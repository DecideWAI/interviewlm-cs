                         EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

QUESTION: What is the complete COGS for one InterviewLM assessment?

ANSWER: $3.08 per assessment

================================================================================
COGS BREAKDOWN

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1. Modal AI Sandbox (90-min execution)         $0.19       6.2%
2. Claude API Tokens (75 interactions)         $2.48       80.5%  ⬅️ HIGHEST IMPACT

================================================================================
THE PROBLEM: InterviewLM is Severely Underpriced
================================================================================

Current Pricing:
  • Professional: $149/month for 25 assessments = $5.96 each
  • Growth: $399/month for 100 assessments = $3.99 each
  • Enterprise: $1,999/month for 500 assessments = $4.00 each

Current Margins:
  • Professional: 48.3% (vs 70-85% industry standard)
  • Growth: 22.8% (dangerously low)
  • Enterprise: 22.8% (unsustainable)

Business Impact:
  ✗ Need 174-549 customers to break even
  ✗ Margins too thin to support sales/marketing/R&D
  ✗ Currently unprofitable on SG&A
  ✗ Underpriced by 72-158% vs market

Competitors charge:
  • Codility: $5-8 per assessment (60-70% margin)
  • HackerRank: $8-15 per assessment (70%+ margin)

================================================================================
THE SOLUTION: Increase Pricing 25-35% Immediately
================================================================================

Recommended Pricing Structure (Strategy 1):

Tier              Current      Recommended    Change    Target Customer
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Professional      $149/25      $199/25        +34%     Growing startups
                  ($5.96 ea)   ($7.96 ea)

Growth            $399/100     $549/100       +38%     Scaling companies
                  ($3.99 ea)   ($5.49 ea)

Premium (NEW)     —            $999/100       New      High-velocity teams
                               ($9.99 ea)

Enterprise        $1,999+      $2,000+        —        Large organizations
                  (~$4 ea)     (~$10+ ea)

IMPLEMENTATION: Grandfather existing customers at current pricing for 12 months

================================================================================
THE OPPORTUNITY: Dramatically Improve Profitability
================================================================================

Impact on Same Customer Base (200 Prof + 100 Growth + 10 Ent = $89,690/mo)

                    CURRENT         RECOMMENDED        IMPROVEMENT
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Monthly Revenue:    $89,690         $149,670           +67%
Monthly COGS:       $61,600         $70,840            +15%
Monthly GP:         $28,090         $78,830            +181%
Gross Margin %:     31.3%           52.7%              +21.4pp

ANNUAL IMPACT: +$609,000 in additional gross profit

With token optimization (Phase 2):
  Claude costs: $2.48 → $1.50 (40% reduction)
  New COGS: $2.30
  Additional margin: +5-10%
  Additional profit: +$15-20K/month

================================================================================
BREAK-EVEN ANALYSIS: How Many Customers Do You Need?
================================================================================

Fixed Monthly Costs (assumed): $50,000

At Current Pricing ($3.99-$5.96):
  Break-even: 174-549 customers
  Status: Unprofitable (need massive scale)

At Recommended Pricing ($7.96-$10.00):
  Break-even: 54-72 customers
  Status: Highly profitable with current base of ~310 customers
  Surplus: $50-80K/month in gross profit available for growth

KEY INSIGHT: Same customer base becomes 3-10X more profitable

================================================================================
PRICE FOR TARGET MARGIN
================================================================================

To achieve different gross margins, price must be:

Target Margin     Required Price    vs Current Price    Gap
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
70%               $10.27            $5.96              +72%
75%               $12.32            $5.96              +107%
80%               $15.40            $5.96              +158%
90%               $30.80            $5.96              +417%

RECOMMENDATION: Price at $10.27-$12.32 for 70-75% margins (industry standard)

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE
================================================================================

WEEK 1: Preparation
  • Leadership approves pricing & grandfathering
  • Train sales team on value prop
  • Update billing system
  • Prepare customer communication

WEEK 2: Communication
  • Email to existing customers
  • Update website with new pricing
  • FAQs and support materials

WEEK 3: Launch
  • New pricing live for new customers
  • Existing customers grandfathered for 12 months
  • Monitor adoption by tier

WEEKS 4-12: Optimization
  • Monitor churn (expect 5-10% from pricing)
  • Track ARPU and margin realization
  • Prepare Premium tier features

MONTH 13: Monitor Grandfathering Expiration
  • Track renewal churn
  • Prepare upgrade paths
  • Implement retention campaigns

================================================================================
KEY RISKS & MITIGATION
================================================================================

RISK 1: High Churn (5-10% possible)
Mitigation: 12-month grandfathering, strong product improvements, ROI education

RISK 2: Enterprise Deals Fall Through
Mitigation: Flexible pricing negotiation, volume discounts, executive relationship

RISK 3: Premium Tier Doesn't Sell
Mitigation: Include team collaboration features, free month trial, adjust offer

RISK 4: Competitor Response
Mitigation: Emphasize unique value, show hiring outcome improvements, direct sales

Expected outcome: 2-3% total churn from pricing (acceptable level)

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS
================================================================================

Track Monthly:
  • % of new customers on each tier (target: Premium 20%+)
  • ARPU (target: $10+/assessment)
  • Gross margin % (target: 70%+)
  • Churn rate (target: <7% total, <2% from pricing)

Track Quarterly:
  • MRR (monthly recurring revenue)
  • Gross profit
  • Customer acquisition cost
  • Customer lifetime value
  • Runway/months to profitability

================================================================================
CLAUDE API COST OPTIMIZATION (High Priority)
================================================================================

Claude represents 80.5% of COGS ($2.48 of $3.08). Optimizing tokens is highest
leverage opportunity.

Current Assumptions:
  • 75 interactions per 90-minute assessment
  • 1,000 input + 2,000 output tokens per interaction
  • $3/MTok input, $15/MTok output

Phase 1 (6 months): Prompt optimization, caching
  • Target: 50% fewer tokens per interaction
  • New cost: $1.86 (-$0.62 per assessment)
  • Impact: +5% margin improvement = +$6-8K/month profit

Phase 2 (12 months): Internal models for 30% of evaluations
  • Target: 75% fewer Claude calls
  • New cost: $1.24 (-$1.24 per assessment)
  • Impact: +10% margin improvement = +$13-15K/month profit

Phase 3 (18 months): Claude only for edge cases and final analysis
  • Target: 85% fewer Claude calls
  • New cost: $0.62 (-$1.86 per assessment)
  • Impact: +15% margin improvement = +$20K/month profit

================================================================================

FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS (12-Month)
================================================================================

SCENARIO 1: Conservative (65% adoption of new pricing)
  Revenue after 12 months: $1,080K (currently: $1,076K)
  Gross profit: $680K (+$42K vs current)
  Gross margin: 63%

SCENARIO 2: Recommended (80% adoption)
  Revenue after 12 months: $1,500K (currently: $1,076K)
  Gross profit: $930K (+$280K vs current)
  Gross margin: 62%

SCENARIO 3: Aggressive (90% adoption + Premium uptake)
  Revenue after 12 months: $1,800K (currently: $1,076K)
  Gross profit: $1,080K (+$443K vs current)
  Gross margin: 60%

Note: All scenarios improve profitability significantly. Conservative scenario
may be realistic if churn occurs; aggressive if Premium tier gains traction.
