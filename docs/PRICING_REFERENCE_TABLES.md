## Sales Scripts & Talking Points

### For PAYGO → Small Pack Upgrade

```
Scenario: Customer has used 7 assessments, 2 remaining on trial

SCRIPT:
"I noticed you've been using InterviewLM effectively. If you find
yourself using 8+ assessments per month, the Small Pack at $90 is
actually more economical than our $10 per-assessment pricing.

That's $9 per assessment versus $10 - savings start immediately if
you're doing more than 10 tests monthly."

KEY TALKING POINTS:
✓ No expiration - use them whenever you need
✓ Immediate $1 per assessment savings
✓ Better for budgeting (fixed monthly cost)
✓ Easy to upgrade to Medium Pack later
```

### For Small → Medium Pack Upgrade

```
Scenario: Small Pack customer showing 30+ usage/month

SCRIPT:
"Your usage has grown to 30+ assessments monthly, which is fantastic!
The Medium Pack at $375 (50 assessments) is significantly better
economics than repeating small packs.

You're currently spending $90/month on 10 tests. Medium gives you
$7.50 per test versus $9. For your usage level, that's $200+ monthly
savings while getting more features like analytics and custom library."

KEY TALKING POINTS:
✓ 25% discount vs PAYGO
✓ Advanced analytics (new feature)
✓ Custom assessment library (new feature)
✓ Priority support (vs email only)
✓ Only $285 difference to 5x the assessments
```

### For Medium → Large Pack Upgrade

```
Scenario: Medium Pack customer hitting limits at 50/month

SCRIPT:
"Your hiring is accelerating - that's wonderful. Your current pack
costs $375 for 50 assessments. With your growing pipeline, I want
to make sure you're not hitting limits unexpectedly.

The Large Pack covers 200 assessments for $1,200. That's 4x more
capacity for just 3x the cost - from $7.50 to $6 per assessment.
More importantly, you get team collaboration tools and 24/7 support."

KEY TALKING POINTS:
✓ 40% discount vs PAYGO
✓ Never run out of assessments mid-hiring
✓ Team collaboration features (new)
✓ 24/7 support (vs business hours)
✓ Bulk candidate tools (new)
✓ Custom branding (new)
```

### For Any Tier → Enterprise

```
Scenario: Large Pack customer or 500+ annual assessment need

SCRIPT:
"At your volume - 500+ assessments annually - you qualify for our
Enterprise program. This includes:

• Custom per-test pricing (typically $4-5 instead of $6)
• Dedicated account manager for your team
• 24/7 phone and email support
• Custom integrations (Workday, Greenhouse, Lever, etc.)
• Service level agreements (SLA)
• White-glove onboarding and training

Let's schedule time with our sales team to discuss a package tailored
to your specific hiring needs and team size."

✓ 50% discount vs PAYGO possible
✓ Dedicated support and CSM
✓ Custom integrations
✓ Binding SLA agreements

## FAQ Quick Reference

### Pricing Questions

```
Q: What's the difference between prepaid and subscription?

A: Prepaid packs are one-time purchases of assessments.
   Subscriptions are monthly, recurring with included assessments.

   Prepaid:
   ✓ Better for variable hiring
   ✓ No expiration
   ✓ Pay once, use anytime

   Subscription:
   ✓ Better for consistent hiring
   ✓ Predictable monthly cost
   ✓ Included support/features


Q: If I don't use all my credits, do they expire?

A: No, InterviewLM prepaid credits never expire. You can use them
   whenever you need. This is different from monthly subscriptions
   which reset each month.


Q: What if I exceed my monthly allocation?

A: For subscriptions, you're charged the overage rate:
   - Starter: $8 per extra assessment
   - Professional: $7 per extra
   - Growth: $5 per extra
   - Scale: $4 per extra

   For prepaid packs, you purchase additional packs as needed.


Q: Can I change plans anytime?

A: Yes, subscriptions can be changed monthly. Prepaid can be upgraded
   to a larger pack anytime. No contract penalties.


Q: What's the cheapest option for a small company?

A: It depends on your hiring frequency:

   - 1-5/month: PAYGO ($10 each) = $10-50/month
   - 5-10/month: Small Pack ($90) = $9 per assessment
   - 10+/month: Professional Sub ($199) = $6.63 per assessment

   Most cost-effective overall: Start with small pack after free trial


Q: Do you offer annual discounts?

A: Yes! Annual prepayment gets 17% off monthly subscriptions.

   Professional: $199/month = $1,988/year ($166/month)
   Growth: $499/month = $4,989/year ($416/month)
   Scale: $1,299/month = $12,989/year ($1,083/month)


Q: Is there a free trial?

A: Yes, 14-day free trial with 10 free assessments. No credit card
   required. Full access to all features.


Q: What happens after my trial?

A: After 14 days, you choose a plan or we ask you to upgrade. We
   don't charge you without explicit consent. Many customers stay on
   PAYGO initially, then upgrade to packs as usage grows.
