## SECTION 1: CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION TEMPLATES

### Email 1: Grandfathering Announcement (Week 1, Send to Existing 310 Customers)

**Subject:** We're investing in InterviewLM—existing customers are protected

**From:** CEO

**Body:**

---

Hi [Customer Name],

Thank you for being an early believer in InterviewLM. Your trust has been instrumental in validating our vision.

Over the past 6 months, we've seen firsthand how AI proficiency assessment changes hiring outcomes:
- Teams identifying AI-native developers see 30-40% productivity uplift
- Time-to-hire drops from 3-4 weeks to just 5-7 days
- Bad hire prevention saves companies $100K+ per avoided hire

We've received overwhelming feedback: **Your biggest wish isn't cheaper assessments—it's better hiring outcomes.**

That's why we're investing heavily in InterviewLM. New features launching soon:

✓ **Advanced Analytics Dashboard** - Understand AI proficiency across your team
✓ **Custom Problem Libraries** - Assessments tailored to your tech stack
✓ **Team Collaboration Tools** - Easier candidate review & decision-making
✓ **Industry Benchmarking** - See how your candidates compare to your industry
✓ **Dedicated Support** - Premium tier customers get a named account manager

### Here's What This Means For You

We're updating pricing for new customers starting [DATE]. But here's the important part:

**You're grandfathered at your current price for the next 12 months.** No surprise increases, no hidden fees. Our way of saying thanks for believing in us early.

After 12 months, pricing will move to our new structure. We'll give you plenty of notice and options to extend at current rates if you prefer.

### What Should You Do?

Nothing. Your pricing doesn't change. Keep using InterviewLM exactly as you are today.

If you want to explore Premium features (dedicated support, advanced analytics), we'll give you 30 days free to try. No pressure, no commitment.

### Questions?

Reply to this email or set up time with [CSM Name]: [calendar link]

We're grateful for your partnership.

Best,

### Email 2: Sales Objection Response Email (For Sales Team When Churn Risk Detected)

**Subject:** InterviewLM pricing—why we changed, why you should stay

**Tone:** Friendly, consultative (not defensive)

**Body:**

---

Hi [Customer Name],

I noticed our pricing update might have caught you by surprise. I want to explain the reasoning because I think you'll find it makes sense.

### Why We Changed Pricing

We were charging $10/assessment, which sounds cheap. But let's look at actual value:

**What you get from InterviewLM:**
- Identify developers who code 30-40% faster with AI tools
- Prevent ~40% of bad hires through early screening
- Reduce time-to-hire by 80% (9-15 days saved per hire)

**What one of those outcomes is worth:**
- One prevented bad hire: $110K average cost
- 10 prevented bad hires/year: $1.1M saved
- At $10 per assessment: You're paying 0.09% of value received

So pricing at $10 was like saying: "This is a commodity tool" when really it's strategic talent intelligence.

### Our New Pricing

New customers are moving to $15-20/assessment depending on usage. But here's what matters:

**You're still grandfathered at current pricing for 12 months.** We're not forcing a change, and we're not increasing your costs today.

### Why This Matters to You

Better pricing (that signals quality) actually makes us a better company:
- We can hire better engineers → Better product
- We can invest in new features → More value to you
- We can compete with HackerRank/Codility → Not get bought out and lose support

Companies with razor-thin margins get acquired or go out of business. Companies with healthy margins build great products.

### What Should You Do?

Keep using InterviewLM as usual. Your grandfathering is locked in for 12 months. When it expires, we'll work with you on options that make sense.

In the meantime, if you hit any obstacles or have questions, I'm here to help.

Best,
[Sales Rep Name]

## SECTION 2: SALES TEAM TALKING POINTS

### Situation: New Prospect Asks "Why $20 When Competitor is $15?"

**Bad Response:**
> "Well, uh, our platform is better... better AI evaluation... more features..."

**Good Response:**
> "Great question. Let me show you why the price difference matters.
>
> HackerRank at $15 is measuring pure coding—great if you want to verify someone can code.
>
> We at $20 measure AI proficiency—specifically, how effectively someone uses Claude and AI tools to ship faster code.
>
> Here's the actual difference:
> - Hire with HackerRank: Developer takes 12 weeks to ramp, requires heavy AI training
> - Hire with InterviewLM: Developer takes 4 weeks to ramp, already AI-native
>
> That's 8 weeks of faster productivity. At $120K salary, that's $18.5K of value difference per hire. You're paying $5 more per assessment to capture that value.
>
> So the real question isn't 'Why $20 not $15'—it's 'Would you rather save $5/assessment or identify developers who ship 8 weeks faster?'"

### Situation: Prospect Says "That's Too Expensive for Our Budget"

**Bad Response:**
> "OK, let me check if we have any discounts available..."

**Good Response:**
> "I understand. Let me reframe the budget question:
>
> What's your current recruiting spend per hire? [Listen for answer, typically $5-10K]
>
> If we run 50 assessments to hire 1 person, that's $1,000 on InterviewLM. Compare that to:
> - Time-to-hire acceleration: $2K-$3K value per hire
> - Preventing one bad hire: $110K value
>
> So the assessment cost isn't really a 'recruiting tool expense'—it's an insurance policy against bad hires and a way to hire 8 weeks faster.
>
> Most companies would pay extra for that insurance. Does that reframe things?"

### Situation: Prospect Compares to LeetCode ($8-15)

**Bad Response:**
> "LeetCode is good for candidate prep, not really for hiring assessment..."

**Good Response:**
> "LeetCode is actually for candidate self-study, not company hiring. They do have an enterprise offering at $8-15, which is clever positioning.
>
> Here's the difference:
> - LeetCode measures algorithm skills (on-premise, isolated environment)
> - InterviewLM measures real-world development with AI (real Claude Code CLI)
>
> It's like comparing a flight simulator to actual flight training. Both teach aviation, but one is obviously more relevant for the job.
>
> The developers you hire after training with LeetCode often need weeks to adjust to AI-assisted coding. The developers you hire after InterviewLM assessment are immediately productive.
>
> Worth the extra $5-12 per assessment?"

### Situation: Enterprise Customer Negotiates on Price

**Bad Response:**
> "Our pricing is fixed. $20 per assessment for everyone."

**Good Response (Anchor High, Negotiate Down):**
> "For enterprise partnerships, we work with companies on custom pricing. Let me explain our structure:
>
> Standard pricing is $20/assessment. For companies committing to volume (5,000+ annually), we can look at tiered discounting:
> - 2,000-5,000 assessments: $18/assessment
> - 5,000-10,000: $16-17/assessment
> - 10,000+: Custom (with dedicated account management)
>
> We can also structure this as annual commitments (10-15% discount for multi-year) or add-on services bundled in.
>
> What does your assessment volume look like annually?"

**Negotiation Strategy:**
- Always anchor at $20+ (anchor effect)
- Offer path to $18-22 as "enterprise discount"
- Customer feels they "negotiated down"
- You keep healthy margin (60%+)
- Include service/support to justify premium

## SECTION 3: INTERNAL TEAM SCRIPTS

### Sales Standup Talking Point (Daily Week 1)

> "Our pricing is moving to premium positioning starting today. We're going from 'cheap assessment tool' to 'hiring intelligence platform.'
>
> This means:
> 1. Always lead with value, not price
> 2. When prospects ask about cost, talk about ROI
> 3. Compare to bad hire cost ($110K), not competitor prices
> 4. New customers see $15-20 pricing
> 5. Existing customers are grandfathered 12 months
>
> If a prospect is price-sensitive, that might actually mean they're not the right fit. We're after customers who optimize for quality, not cost.
>
> Any pricing objections, escalate to [Sales Lead]. We're tracking closely."

### Customer Success Standup (First Week)

> "Heads up: We've made a pricing change this week. Existing customers are grandfathered—their pricing doesn't change for 12 months. New customers see new pricing.
>
> If an existing customer reaches out confused or concerned, the talking point is:
> - We're investing in the platform (new features coming)
> - Existing customers are grandfathered as thanks for being early
> - No action needed on their part
> - If they want to explore premium features, we'll give 30 days free
>
> Keep me posted if we see any churn signals."

### Week 2 Leadership Update Template

> "Pricing Update – Week 2 Results
>

> - Tier distribution: [% Starter, % Professional, % Premium, % Enterprise]
> - Target: 40% Prof, 15% Premium, 5% Enterprise

>
> **Existing Customers:**

## SECTION 4: COMPETITIVE POSITIONING SCRIPTS

### For "We Already Use HackerRank" Objection

**Script:**
> "HackerRank is great for what it does—pure coding assessment at scale. But here's what they don't measure:
>
> Today's reality: 95% of developers use Claude or ChatGPT daily.
> Tomorrow's reality: All developers will be AI-native.
>
> HackerRank measures 'coding without AI'—a skill being automated.
> InterviewLM measures 'shipping faster with AI'—the skill that matters.
>
> Your top performers aren't the fastest coders anymore. They're the ones who ask Claude the right questions and know when to accept/reject AI suggestions.
>
> Want to see what a real AI proficiency assessment looks like? Let me show you a sample [90 min assessment] and the AI proficiency metrics we surface."

### For "Your Platform is Too New" Objection

**Script:**
> "You're right, we're younger than HackerRank or Codility. But here's why that matters positively:
>
> Legacy platforms are built for assessment as a checkbox—prove someone can code.
> We're built for assessment as strategy—identify AI-native talent.
>
> We've shipped features in 4 weeks that HackerRank takes quarters to build:
> - Real Claude Code CLI (not simulation)
> - AI proficiency scoring
> - Advanced collaboration tools
>
> Plus, we move faster. If a feature doesn't work, we fix it within days, not months.
>
> We're backed by [investors], customers include [logos], and we have 500+ companies already using the platform.
>
> Most importantly: We're focused on outcome metrics your team cares about—quality of hire and time-to-productivity. HackerRank optimizes for compliance."

### For "What if InterviewLM Gets Acquired?" Risk

**Script:**
> "That's a fair question. Here's how we're thinking about it:
>
> 1. We're building this to be a stand-alone company, not to sell to HackerRank or Codility. Our business model (healthy margins, strong unit economics) makes us more attractive to customers than if we're desperate.
>
> 2. If we were acquired, it would likely be by someone who wants to acquire the IP and customer base because it's valuable. That's a good sign, not bad.
>
> 3. We're operating as a standalone for at least the next 3-5 years. That's plenty of time for the platform to mature.
>
> 4. Most importantly: The shift toward AI proficiency assessment is inevitable. If not InterviewLM, then someone else will own this category. I'd rather partner with the team that invented it."

## SECTION 5: HANDLING CHURN

### Red Flags for Churn Risk (Monitor Daily Week 1)

- Customer asks "Why did you raise prices?" in support
- Existing customer downgrades to lower tier
- Trial customer signs up but doesn't create assessment
- Enterprise customer goes quiet after pricing announcement
- Competitor mentioned in churn feedback

### Churn Prevention Process

**Trigger 1: Grandfathering Email Bounces Back**
- Action: Get corrected email from customer contact
- Opportunity: Re-frame value proposition while you have attention

**Trigger 2: Customer Doesn't Use Platform for 2 Weeks**
- Action: Proactive outreach from CSM
- Message: "Haven't seen you using InterviewLM. Everything OK? Any blockers?"
- Opportunity: Add feature education, drive engagement

**Trigger 3: Churn Notice Received**
- Action: Immediate escalation to CEO/Founder
- Last offer: [Free month, feature access, price negotiation]
- Learning: Exit interview on why they left

**Trigger 4: Price Objection in Sales**
- Action: Immediate positioning discussion with sales rep
- Coaching: Value-based argument (not price-based concession)
- Outcome: Either win on value or let go (they're wrong customer)

### Churn Response Template (CSM Email)

**Subject:** Let's talk about your InterviewLM experience

**Body:**

> Hi [Name],
>
> I noticed your InterviewLM account hasn't been active this week. I wanted to check in and see if there's anything blocking you.
>
> Sometimes when accounts go quiet, it's because:
> - Feature they need isn't obvious (easy fix, I can help)
> - Pricing change caught them off-guard (happy to discuss)
> - Different tool solved their immediate need (completely OK)
> - Technical issue (we can troubleshoot)
>
> I'd love to jump on a quick call and see if there's anything we can solve. Even if InterviewLM isn't the right fit long-term, I want to understand what didn't work.
>
> Available [2-3 time options]. No pressure either way.
>
> Best,
> [CSM Name]
