**CLEAR RECOMMENDATION:**
Implement Premium Positioning Strategy

### Topic 5: Positioning Strategy

**Documents:**
- MARKET_ANALYSIS section 5
- PRICING_CHANGE_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAYBOOK section 1-4

**Strategy:**
- Messaging: "Premium Hiring Intelligence" not "Cheap Assessment"
- Positioning: Quality signal (high price = high quality)
- Sales narrative: Value-based (ROI), not cost-based
- Market segments: AI-native startups (premium), Enterprise (volume)
- Sales collateral: Outcome metrics, not feature comparison

### Topic 6: Risk Analysis

**Documents:**
- MARKET_ANALYSIS section 7
- VALUE_PRICING_RECOMMENDATION_BRIEF (Risk section)

**Key Risks & Mitigations:**
1. Churn too high: 12-month grandfathering reduces from 15-20% to 2-5%
2. Enterprise deals fail: Enterprise negotiation room ($25 anchor → $18-22)
3. New customers avoid premium: Sales training on value positioning
4. Competitor response: 12-18 month technical lead, first-mover moat
5. COGS increase: Token optimization offsets, premium pricing provides buffer
