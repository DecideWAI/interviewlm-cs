## Appendix C: FAQ for Sales Team

**Q: Why not offer more aggressive discounts?**
A: 50% discount maintains 70% gross margin with $1.50 COGS. More aggressive would compress margins below 60%.

**Q: Can we offer custom pricing below 500 credits?**
A: Only in rare cases. Stay disciplined with tier-based pricing to avoid margin erosion.

**Q: What if customer says competitor is cheaper?**
A: Compare total offering - we're 3-4x faster to set up, have better AI evaluation, and lower error rates. Value > Price.

**Q: How do we handle large customers wanting better discounts?**
A: For 1000+ annual assessments, consider multi-year contracts with volume rebates rather than lower base price.

**Q: Should we offer 10-assessment trial packs?**
A: Yes - 10 free assessments during trial, then upgrade to Small Pack recommended.
